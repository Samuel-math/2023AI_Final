# 2023AI_Final
这段代码作为我2023秋季学期人工智能课程的期末论文的代码，简单比较了ViT、SimpleViT、ResNet18和普通的两层卷积神经网络在选取CIFAR-10上不同大小的训练子集训练后的表现，并进行了一定的可视化操作，同时也比较了训练的时间。
This code is for my final thesis of AI class in the first semester of 2023-2024. I made some comparision of the accurency on the CIFAR-10 between ViT, SimpleVit, ResNet18 and simple convolution of two layers, when they are trained on the different size of training data. In addtion, I also got the time they spent on training.
